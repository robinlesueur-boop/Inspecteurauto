The AI engineer successfully bootstrapped the Inspecteur Auto application, establishing a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup with core functionalities like JWT authentication, module management (free/premium), user progression, PDF certificate generation, Stripe integration, a forum, and an admin dashboard. Initially, the AI engineer provided a summary of the existing app and made it operational by fixing missing frontend admin pages (, ). Subsequent work focused on fulfilling a large set of new requirements for Qualiopi compliance and enhancing the learning experience, including dynamic module content generation (with difficulties meeting word count targets), sequential module access, a pre-registration questionnaire, and two new preliminary quizzes. The AI debugged quiz submission issues and frontend routing. The current state involves partially implemented content generation and ongoing integration of the new preliminary quizzes and module flow.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to develop an Inspecteur Auto training platform. The initial product vision included a full-stack application with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. Key features already implemented and validated (as per AI's initial summary, with subsequent fixes):
- **User Management**: Complete authentication (JWT registration/login), user tracking.
- **Course Management**: Training modules (free/premium), user progression system, automatic PDF certificate generation (ReportLab).
- **Payments**: Stripe integration for payments (fixed to 297€), including payable 4 fois sans frais (pending implementation for 4x payment).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the newly created preliminary quizzes and addressing content length issues.

**Specific actions:**
1.  **Creation of Preliminary Quizzes**: The AI engineer created a backend script () to generate two new quizzes:
    *   Quiz Adéquation Métier (profile suitability quiz).
    *   Quiz Connaissances Mécaniques (mechanical knowledge quiz).
    These quizzes have been successfully created in the database.
2.  **Module 2 Content Enrichment**: The AI engineer attempted to enrich Module 2 (now renamed Remise à Niveau Mécanique) with a target of 20,000+ words. A script was run, which updated Module 2 content, but only to approximately 3,545 words, falling short of the user's explicit requirement for 20,000 words.
3.  **Prioritization**: The AI engineer decided to prioritize the integration of these new quizzes into the user flow over spending more time on the extensive content generation for Module 2, with the understanding that content can be enriched progressively.

The state of the product is that the two new preliminary quizzes exist in the backend. Module 2 has been renamed and has some enriched content, but not to the full desired length. The frontend integration for these new quizzes has not yet begun.
